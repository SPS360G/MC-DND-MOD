# MC-DND-MOD
We are going to make a D&D minecraft Mod and are going to implemt the main classes and races into it. We wil also be implemeting the main game rules inculding randomness such as attack rolls and damage rolls and random hp and stats depending on class, race and level Armour will be reworked to instead of decreecing damage to decricign the chance of being hit and will work with the attack and damage rolls. You will be able to select a class and race when you begin and recive starting equipment. Muticlassing will be availible if you get your hands on a class secific multiclass token and meet the preqursites, with a total level cap of 20 (might make this chagable in a config file to allow more than 20 levels).
